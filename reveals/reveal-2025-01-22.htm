        The phrase implies that seemingly free benefits always carry hidden or implicit costs, even if not borne directly by the recipient. 
        This reflects the principle of opportunity cost, which states that every choice involves trade-offs.

        The expression traces back to the 19th-century practice in American saloons, where patrons were offered "free" lunches contingent upon purchasing drinks. 
        These lunches, often high in salt, encouraged customers to buy more beverages, illustrating that the lunch wasn't genuinely free.

        Economist Milton Friedman propagated the phrase in his book <i>There’s No Such Thing as a Free Lunch</i> in 1975, 
        highlighting the hidden costs of government programs and economic policies. A fierce advocate for free-market capitalism, 
        Friedman supported minimal government intervention, asserting that restoring free markets would be the ‘real free lunch’, 
        as opposed to government provisions, which violate market efficiency and personal freedom. This idea has been challenged across history.

        This phrase is also often used in the realm of investing, warning investors to be wary of opportunities that seem too good to be true—there 
        is no such thing as return without risk. Today, investment scams run rampant, 
        feeding upon the dangerous human complacency that they, in particular, are going to be the special one to make it big.
