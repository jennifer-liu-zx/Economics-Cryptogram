        The quote is commonly attributed to Milton Friedman, a prominent American economist and Nobel laureate. 
        He used the phrase in his writings and speeches to explain the economic consequences of inflation. 
        It is cited in his popular works, including <i>Free to Choose</i> (published in 1980, co-authored with Rose Friedman), 
        and reflects his advocacy for responsible government policies. 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Here, Friedman was explaining how inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, 
        effectively reducing individuals’ real wealth without direct action by the government in the form of passing laws to increase taxes. 
        His critique came during the 1970s, as the US abandoned the gold standard and put into place highly restrictive policies to control the fallout,
        including price, wage controls and employment stimulation. As soon as policies were lifted, however, the economy exploded. Inflation reached level of 12%--
        or, as Friedman argued, even higher than that--and stagflation became a prime concern. To protect households from inflationary shocks, 
        Friedman proposed indexation on income taxes and escalator clauses.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The comparison is apt insofar as it refers to the broad effects of inflation and taxation on the real value of income and wealth.
        However, it fails to capture the complex and varied causes of inflation, and how taxation and inlfation interact. 
        Another key nuance is that, independently, inflation is necessarily a regressive "tax", whereas legislated taxes can be flat or progressive.
        Hence, taxes are not only a burden to purchasing power, but also a distrbutive tool that allows the government to target specific parts of the economy to various ends.
