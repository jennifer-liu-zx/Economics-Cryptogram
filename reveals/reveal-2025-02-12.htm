        This phrase is most commonly associated with John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, though numerous uses of the saying predate him. 
        He used it in a speech in 1963 while advocating for the infrastructure projects which have far-reaching benefits for the economy of American states.
        The saying was the slogan of the New England Council, which is where Kennedy's speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, picked it up from.
        However, the saying predates both of them by decades, if not centuries.
        Interestingly enough, the phrase 水涨船高, which literally translates to "water rise boat high", appears in Buddhist text 《五灯会元·芭蕉继彻禅师》 (<i>Compendium of the Five Lamps</i>) by Song Dynasty monk Shi Puji (释普济) in the 12th century.
        Clearly, the image is ubiquitous across time and space.

        Kennedy used the phrase to explain his belief that general economic growth benefits all members of society. 
        His administration promoted broad-based economic policies, including tax cuts, with the view that a growing economy would create prosperity across income levels and social classes. 
        The metaphor implies that when the overall economy (the tide) improves, all individuals (boats) are lifted by it, regardless of their starting point. 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The economic policies of the Kennedy administration were generally positively received. Tax cuts to corporations and individuals led to greater economic flow from investment and consumption,
        leading a bounceback of the American economy after the recession of the late 1950s. This was implemented in tandem to numerous welfare and infrastructure programmes to stimulate the economy and lift citizens out of poverty.

        Today, it is recognised that economic growth often does not apply to all equally. For example,
        low to middle income workers often see a crawl or even stagnation of their real wages even when real growth is taking place.
        In addition, some parties disprioportionately suffer from the byproducts of unrestrained growth, like environmental damage.
        And this highlights the importance of economic policies that are inclusive and sustainable.
